# Structure - Overview

___

## Input

1. Bitbake reads a series of conf files to determine which other conf files,
   layers, and global variables to use.
2. Bitbake uses variables from these conf files to determine where to look for
   recipes, recipes appends, classes and includes.

___

## Caching

- [Downloads](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#structure-build-downloads)
  stores the output of the 'fetch' task and is used as an input to the 'unpack'
  task.
- [Shared State Cache](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#structure-build-sstate-cache)
  stores the results of tasks which than can be used instead of rerunning the
  task in some scenarios. Read the manual for more information about
  [Shared State](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#shared-state).

___

## Output

1. Everything under the
   [build directory](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#structure-build)
   should be considered disposable.
2. The configuration files in build/conf should be generated before bitbake is
   run.
3. By default the caching directories mentioned above are also in the build
   directory.
